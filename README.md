# Understanding Strapi

Strapi is a ready-made backend for applications.  

- Every serious app has a frontend, backend, and database.  
- Backend is mostly the same for all apps: CRUD operations, complex read APIs, RBAC (who can access what), and file uploads.  
- Strapi handles all of this automatically, so developers don’t have to write it from scratch.  
- With Strapi, backend setup that normally takes weeks can be done in a day.  
- This lets us focus on the unique parts of our application instead of boilerplate backend work.

In short, Strapi **speeds up backend development** and makes it easy to manage data, APIs, and access control.
